            "description": "No one, including federal airspace czars, seems to know with any authority just how many drones are flying around domestic airspace. The Federal Aviation Administration has prophesied that there could be upwards of 30,000 drones in the air by 2030, but lists of which government players are flying UAVs at present vary considerably.\r\n\r\n**So we’re counting the drones. All of them. And you’re going to help.**\r\n\r\n<p>The Drone Census 2013-2014 is a joint initiative between <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/introducing-the-motherboard-muckrock-drone-census\">Motherboard</a> and MuckRock. Together, we’re uncovering precisely which government agencies across the country are using drones, the various purposes for which they're flown, and whether appropriate safeguards are in place to address privacy concerns.\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock started the Drone Census last year in partnership with the <a href=\"eff.org/issues/surveillance-drones\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. In our first round, we asked <a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com/drone-census-2012/\">more than 350 government agencies</a> across the country for details of their drone use, or lack thereof. With help from more than 100 tip submissions, MuckRock uncovered new details of the <a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2012/oct/11/two-seattle-police-drones-sit-unused-department-se/\">Seattle drone scandal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/mar/01/maine-state-police-toy-drone/\">Maine State Police's \"toy\" UAV purchase sans FAA oversight</a> and <a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/jan/24/georgia-tech-police-wanted-fly-surveillance-drone-/\">Georgia Tech's grandiose plan to fly drones at football games</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>The second iteration of the Drone Census is bigger, more exhaustive and even higher-flying. We intend to (literally) write the book on domestic drones. Watch this space and the <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/tag/the\\+drone\\+census\">Motherboard site</a> over the coming weeks for updates and analysis on who has drones, what they're doing with them and whether privacy concerns are being taken into account. And tell us where to look for them by submitting government agency tips at the bottom of this page.\r\n\r\n## What we've found so far\r\n\r\n<p>Documents continue to pour in from agencies across the country, and we're still submitting requests based on your tips and leads. But already, we've outlined the previously unknown <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/fbi-drone-program-documents\">history of the FBI's UAV program</a> (plus the Bureau's <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-fbi-doesnt-know-how-many-drones-it-has-or-whos-allowed-to-fly-them\">difficulty counting its drones</a>), found one drone <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-feds-have-no-idea-whos-flying-drones\">purchased by police in Brunswick, Ga.</a> with federal grants but sans FAA authorization, and <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-nypd-wants-to-fly-spy-drones-over-the-city-but-refuses-to-talk-about-it\">pressed NYPD for details</a> of its drone designs. And we're still digging!\r\n\r\n## Tell us where to look\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s where you come in. As part of the first Drone Census push, MuckRock put out an open call: where do you want us to poke around for drones? Hundreds of people submitted government agencies that piqued their curiosity and hunches. And it paid off. Some of our most fascinating scoops and bizarre findings came from these crowdsourced leads. Your city not one of the ones that we've filed with yet? Click on a request, click \"Clone\", and then type in the place and agency you'd like to file with — it's that simply.",

We intend to FOIA the\r\nNSA and other agencies for their contracts with any companies which either manufacture and sell spy\r\ntechnology to U.S. intelligence agencies, or companies which are forced\r\nto install and use this technology on behalf of the spy agencies.\r\n\r\nAll of the documents posted are legally obtained through the FOIA process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Who's behind this project?</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<A href=\"https://www.twitter.com/abbynormative\">Heather Akers-Healy</a> is an activist and researcher based in California.

Netronome was recently acquired by Blue Coat, a company for which we are currently waiting on FOIA results.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How you can help:</b></p>\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, please create an account. Anyone can participate in this project by filing a FOIA for spy tech or contracts through MuckRock's website and tagging it with \"SpyLighter.\"<b>Please check the link</b> below for existing FOIA requests before filing one on a specific company to make sure it hasn't already been requested. Please also do a search for the company name in the search box to the right as some requests may not be tagged properly and we need to avoid duplicate requests.</p>\r\n<p><b>Tips on filing:</b></p>\r\n<p> \r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\nMake sure to include the full company name and address when seeking\r\ncompany contracts, otherwise your request may be rejected as not\r\nhaving enough information to complete the search. The FOIA office has\r\nin the past processed some of our requests as “key word” searches when\r\nwe had clearly requested a search with the company name. Include as\r\nmuch specific information about what you seek as possible.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The language below was successful in obtaining the Vupen contract.\r\nThis can be a model for your request but please add the address of the\r\ncompany.</li>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\"Copies of contracts with VUPEN Security and any final reports\r\ngenerated and delivered by VUPEN to the agency over the past 10 years.\r\nIf retrieving the contracts themselves is too burdensome please\r\nprovide a list of contracts.\"\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<li>Publicize your requests and responses! Tweet them out, tweet at us\r\nfor retweets, blog them, write about them!\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Ask for help if you get a denial or redaction. You can also search at\r\nMuckrock for how others have handled similar problems or submit a\r\nquestion here: https://www.muckrock.com/questions/\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Get inspired! The following resources might spike your curiosity:</li>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"https://bluecabinet.info\">Telecomix Blue Cabinet</a><br>\r\n<A href=\"https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/\">Wikileaks SpyFiles</a><br>\r\n<A href=\"https://privacyinternational.org/sii/\">Privacy International</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Larger companies (like Raytheon, for example) will have a huge volume\r\nof contracts with the NSA. We think asking for a list of invoices and\r\ntheir associated contract numbers may be a good idea. If successful it\r\nwill allow you to review and select contracts that look interesting for\r\nthe purposes of doing a separate FOIA request.</li>\r\n<li>As far as we're able to tell, NSA contract numbers all start with one\r\nof the following prefixes: MDA904, H98230-yy (where \"yy\" is the two\r\ndigit year, for example H98230-13-C) Prior to filing your request you\r\nmay want to search publicly available information for related contracts.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>From what we can tell, academic grants (usually focused around advanced mathematics/statistics) follow the format with a prefix of: H98230-yy-1</li>\r\n<li>The NSA apparently has a limited search capability that prevents them from doing keyword searches.  Heather attempted to obtain contracts on FinFisher software and received a response stating that by DoD regulation FOIA requests for contracts must contain a company name, contract number, or date.  She is appealing, but this keyword limitation is something to keep in mind when formulating your request.</li>\r\n<li>Again, please avoid submitting a request that has already been sent through the MuckRock website!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</p>",
